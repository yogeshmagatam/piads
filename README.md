# piads
-In this the main goal is to show or preview advertisements using raspberri pi.
-The first step i have done is to take a raspberry pi (you can use any version) then i just created a python file and i wrote the script to run the code
then to run the advertisements i have created a service file to run in the background while the pi is booting or getting started.
-i just wrote the code in such a way that the adds(videos) can be played on the startup ,now you may think i have created a media file but i have limited videos and i wanted to add new video files into it.
-So i have created a web page where you can upload and download the videos.
-For frontend i used html and css and for backend i used python for uploading and downloading the video.
